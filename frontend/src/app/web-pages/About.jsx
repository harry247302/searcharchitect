              <strong>Search Architect</strong> is an online platform that
              intends to bring the topmost architects and people searching for
              such architects under one roof.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4 text-sm md:text-base leading-relaxed">
              <strong>Search Architect’s</strong> aim is to cut down the hassle
              for the customers, who are looking for professional services of
              architects for their various projects like{" "}
              <strong>
                Residential, Industrial, Institutional, Renovation &
                Remodelling, etc.
              </strong>
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4 text-sm md:text-base leading-relaxed">
              And at the same time, we also want to provide architects a
              platform where they could list all their services along with their
              previous work portfolio, contact details, as well as their prices
              so when a potential client contacts them, they are already well
              aware of their work and their work style beforehand and they are
              hand-picked by them.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4 text-sm md:text-base leading-relaxed">
              Thus, this creates more transparency and awareness for both
              parties involved.
